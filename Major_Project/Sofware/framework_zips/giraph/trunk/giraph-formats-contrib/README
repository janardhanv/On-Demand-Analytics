giraph-formats-contrib hosts additional custom input/output formats that contain bulky or heavy-weight dependencies, and
can't be bundled directly in the main giraph jar.

In order to build, the following prerequisite conditions must be met.

1) You must 'mvn install' the latest giraph maven artificat in your local m2 repo. In future releases this will
be not be required in favor of a maven central artifact available for download.

2) A build of core giraph jar with the following absolute path must be available:
    ${giraph.trunk.base}/target/giraph-${project.version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Default checkout has ${giraph.trunk.base} set to the parent directory '..'. This is a relative path to the trunk directory

Once these conditions have been met, you will be able to compile and test giraph-formats-contrib.jar
