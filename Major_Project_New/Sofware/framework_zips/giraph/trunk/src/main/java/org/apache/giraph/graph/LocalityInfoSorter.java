/**
 * Utility class to extract InputSplit locality information
 * from znodes and to sort the InputSplit list for the worker
 * owning this object to favor local data block selection.
 *
 * This class also provides a hash-rotated index by which workers
 * must index into their list of InputSplits, This will be especially
 * helpful to those who do not find local blocks to read, and must
 * contend with other workers for non-local splits in the list.
 *
 * Searching for splits using ZK reads is slowed by the fact that
 * after each ZK write (to mark a split reserved or finished) the
 * ZK quorum must be sync'd before pending read requests can be
 * fulfilled. During InputSplit claiming, the writes are frequent on
 * both reserved and finished node trees; the aim is to cut down on
 * the number of ZK reads workers perform to locate an unclaimed node.
